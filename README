Simple example of a Play app that uses OpenID to handle user authentication.  The first time a new OpenID is authenticated, a new User is created for it.  Subsequent auths reuse that User.

I have successfully authenticated with myopenid.com and flickr.com OpenID providers.  The wordpress.com OpenID provider does not work with this app, not sure why.  I have not tried any other OpenID providers.

Note that this project runs on port 9090 (the default port 9000 was conflicting with something in Eclipse).
